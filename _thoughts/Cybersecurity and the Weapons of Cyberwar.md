# Cybersecurity and the Weapons of Cyberwar

## Notes
- [[Zero day attacks]] have increased in value. Before, iPhone ones were more expensive, in the last couple of years Android's are more profitable.
- Hackers can either sell to nations and earn more, or collect bounties and earn less, but have the street cred of doing it.
- A site can exploit a vulnerability in android, China did this by targeting people who looked on the [[Uyghurs]].
- [[Argentina]] has a very long lasting hacking culture.
