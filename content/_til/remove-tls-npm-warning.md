# Upgrading npm Registry Connections to TLS 1.2+

## Background

Starting October 4, 2021, npm enforced TLS 1.2+ for all registry connections to enhance security. This change affects all package installations and registry interactions. This guide helps you upgrade your environment to meet these security requirements.

## The Warning Message

You might encounter this warning during package installation:

```plaintext
npm notice Beginning October 4, 2021, all connections to the npm registry - including for package installation - must use TLS 1.2 or higher. You are currently using plaintext http to connect.
```

## Understanding the Issue

### Security Context
- TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have known vulnerabilities
- Modern security standards require TLS 1.2 or higher
- Plain HTTP connections are no longer accepted
- This change affects all npm registry interactions

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Node.js Using nvm

[Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended for managing Node.js versions:

```bash
# Install Latest LTS Version (Recommended)
nvm install --lts

# Or Install Latest Stable Version
nvm install node

# List Available Versions
nvm ls-remote

# Use the Installed Version
nvm use --lts
```

### 2. Configure npm Registry

Set the registry to use HTTPS:

```bash
# Set secure registry URL
npm set registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

### 3. Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check current registry setting
npm config get registry

# Should output: https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

### 4. Test TLS Connection

Run the official npm TLS test:

```bash
npm install -g https://tls-test.npmjs.com/tls-test-1.0.0.tgz
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Old Node.js Version**
   ```bash
   # Check current version
   node --version
   
   # Update if below v12
   nvm install --lts
   ```

2. **Registry Configuration**
   ```bash
   # View all npm config
   npm config list
   
   # Reset registry if needed
   npm config delete registry
   npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

3. **Network Issues**
   ```bash
   # Test network connection
   curl -I https://registry.npmjs.org/
   
   # Check for proxy settings
   npm config get proxy
   npm config get https-proxy
   ```

## Best Practices

### 1. Version Management
- Use nvm for Node.js version management
- Keep Node.js updated to latest LTS
- Regularly check for security updates

### 2. Security Configuration
- Always use HTTPS for registry connections
- Implement package-lock.json for dependency locking
- Use npm audit regularly

### 3. CI/CD Considerations
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
    with:
      node-version: 'lts/*'
      registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
```

## Additional Security Measures

### 1. Package Integrity
```bash
# Enable package integrity checks
npm config set audit true
npm config set strict-ssl true
```

### 2. Dependency Auditing
```bash
# Regular security audits
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Advanced security reporting
npm audit --json
```
