- Russia has military and land.
- China has economy and people. 
- Out of the two, [[China]] would be leading partner with, for it has 8x the GDP of Russia, and it's manufacturing power in great, which will make the military of China eventually better. 
- There is no love for Russian culture in China.
- [[Putin]] and [[Xi Jinping]] have called them selves best friends.
- The situation is stable, for now, but in the future China might want to impose it self.
