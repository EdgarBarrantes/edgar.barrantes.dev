# Resolving MetaMask White Screen Issue in Firefox on Linux

## Problem Description

The MetaMask extension in Firefox on Linux systems can sometimes display a white screen instead of the wallet interface, preventing access to your cryptocurrency and web3 applications. This issue typically occurs due to corrupted IndexedDB storage.

## Solution Overview

This guide provides a systematic approach to resolving the white screen issue by manually fixing the IndexedDB storage files. The process involves locating and modifying specific database files in Firefox's storage directory.

## Prerequisites

- Access to your Linux system's terminal
- Basic understanding of file operations
- SQLite browser installed (optional but recommended)
- Backup of your MetaMask wallet seed phrase (essential)

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1. Locate the Storage Directory

Navigate to your Firefox profile directory:
```bash
cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/[PROFILE_ID].default/storage/default/moz-extension+++[UUID]^userContextId=[NUMBER]/idb/
```

> **Note**: Replace placeholders with your specific values:
> - `[PROFILE_ID]`: Your Firefox profile identifier
> - `[UUID]`: MetaMask extension's Internal UUID
> - `[NUMBER]`: Context ID number

### 2. Find the MetaMask Database

Look for a directory ending with `eengsairo.files`. This contains MetaMask's IndexedDB files.

### 3. Identify Required Files

1. Open the SQLite database with a browser like [SQLiteBrowser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
2. In the "Browse Data" tab, locate the file table
3. Note the ID number (we'll call this the MAGIC_NUMBER)

### 4. Fix the Database Files

```bash
# Inside the eengsairo.files directory
cp [highest_numbered_file] [MAGIC_NUMBER]
```

## Safety Precautions

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before proceeding:
1. Ensure you have your MetaMask seed phrase backed up
2. Create backups of all files you'll modify
3. Document the original file structure

## Verification

After completing the steps:
1. Restart Firefox
2. Open MetaMask
3. Verify your wallet loads correctly
4. Check that your accounts and settings are intact
